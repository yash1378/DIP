## Bicubic, Bilinear, Nearest Neighbour, Lanczos Resampling and Wavelet based SR only have the parameters new_width and new_height.

## Fourier based SR contains 2 more parameters other than new width and height, which are radius of circular mask and amplification factor.(By default they are set as 300 and 1.3) 

## Iterative Back Projection has one extra parameter -> iterations(set to 10 by default)

## Total Variation SR has 2 extra parameters -> weight and iterations.

## Non local based SR has 3 extra parameters -> h, template window size and search window size.(set to 10, 3x3 and 11x11 by default)
   Always keep the template window size less than the search window size.

## Information about all these extra parameters and how they affect the image are given in their respective files.

## Image utils file contains 3 functions -> to load an image, to display an image and to draw pixel tracing on an image.
