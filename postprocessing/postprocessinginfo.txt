# Edge detection algorithm has no parameter. (Using Sobel Operator)

# Saturation adjusting algorithm has one parameter -> saturation_scale (set to 1.5 by default)

# Gaussian blur algorithm has two parameters -> kernel_size and sigma (by default kernel_size -> 7 and sigma -> 100)

# Gamma correction algorithm has one parameter -> gamma (set to 0.5 by default). If gamma < 1 , the image will be brightened and if gamma > 1 it will be darkened.
