## ðŸŒŸ Overview

Welcome to our project! This README will guide you through the setup process and help you get started quickly and easily.

## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites

Before beginning the setup, ensure you have the following installed:

- Git (version 2.x or higher)
- Bash shell (Linux/macOS) or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) for Windows users
- [List any specific dependencies, e.g., Python 3.8+, Node.js 14+, etc.]

## ðŸš€ Quick Setup

### Option 1: Automated Setup (Recommended)

We've created a simple `setup.sh` script to streamline the entire project initialization process. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yash1378/DIP.git
   cd DIP
   ```

2. Make the setup script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup.sh
   ```

3. Run the setup script:
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```

The `setup.sh` script will handle the following for you:
- Install system dependencies
- Create virtual environments
- Install project dependencies
- Configure initial settings
- Perform database migrations
- Run initial tests
